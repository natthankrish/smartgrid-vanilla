    <h3>EV Facilitation</h3>
    <div class="section">
        <h4>PLN Initiatives for EV Facilitation</h4>
        <p>PLN is actively incentivizing the adoption and support of electric vehicles (EVs) through a series of strategic initiatives. These include offering reduced connection fees and power change incentives for owners of 4-wheeled KBLBB with home charging setups, as well as for SPKLU and SPBKLU business entities, fostering the growth of charging infrastructure providers. Additionally, PLN offers a 30% discount on electricity tariffs for home chargers used between 22.00-05.00, which helps to reduce peak loads and encourage off-peak charging. The use of electric vehicles within PLN's engineering services fleet further demonstrates their commitment to green energy. Partnerships are being formed to facilitate the provision of SPKLU infrastructure, creating opportunities for non-IUPTL business entities to invest. The construction of various charging stations, from medium to ultra-fast charging, is underway at rest areas, offices, and public facilities across Indonesia. PLN also provides a comprehensive EV Digital Service platform that includes features for charging, battery exchange, an EV marketplace, travel planning, home charger settings, and fostering an EV community. Lastly, SPLU and SPBKLU are being widely deployed throughout the country to support this growing ecosystem.</p>
